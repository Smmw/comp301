Dan Shell
A very simple shell with less features than sh!

To build, simply run 'build.sh':
  ./build.sh

To run:
  ./dsh

The shell's prompt includes your username (if $USER is defined),
the hostname of the machine you're on and also the current working
directory.

You can use any command that doesn't require stdin (as that pipe
hasn't been passed).  There are two special commands; exit and
welcome.

exit
  Exits the shell

welcome <name>
  Greets you with "Hello, <name>!"
