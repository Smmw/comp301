Simple Sheduler
===
This project covers the design and implementation of a really basic scheduler.
The current time for the scheduler is externally defined.

The program accepts an instruction file which makes use
of the following instructions:

* TIME - Sets the current time.
* ADD - Adds a task to occur at a certain time
* ADDREP - Adds a task that will be repeated at a certain rate
* DEL - Removes all instances of a task from the scheduler
* LIST - Lists the schedule in chronological order
* CLEAR - Clears the schedule

Running
---
To build and run the scheduler, just run the following commands.
An example input file is provided (example.in)
    make
    output/scheduler <inputfile>
